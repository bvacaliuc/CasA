# Cas A Observation Program

This is a collection of knowledge, scripts, techniques for an amateur radio astronomy observation program.

Developing a radio astronomy observation program and database is a great learning project.  There are a few key items that should be included in any radio observation program for amateurs or students are:

 1.	Targets to observe
 1.	Methodology for proper interpretation of data
 1.	Quality control
 1.	Optimization of the radio telescope settings for target observations
 1.	Raw data and its processing 
 1.	The database for submission of observations

Radio astronomy, like its optical counterpart, can vary greatly in level of ease and sophistication for the amateur.  Generally speaking though, it is more difficult to master than optical astronomy.  A group of SARA members have been discussing the observation of variable radio sources and how those observations may be of interest
to the professional astronomy community.  Dr. Dan Reichart demonstrated that this is possible for amateurs.  His paper is found at: http://www.gb.nrao.edu/20m/projdocs20m/FadingofCassA_MN469p1299_2017.pdf. While Cas A would be the initial target because of its relative ease, the list of targets could expand as collective amateur experience is achieved.

While the database is not yet built, we need initial observational data from the SARA community and others to help us develop it.  While Skynet has a data attached to it, we realize this is not the format many amateurs will use. Using one example target (Cas A) and multiple sets of data, we hope we have enough actual real inputs to create better construct the SARA template mentioned that will be the basis of a future database.  By constructing a good database, amateurs will begin to use it, both for storing data, as well as a benchmark to compare their data. A database is a central piece in any citizen science program.  The advantages of citizen science are that it not only teaches, but also allows collection of data and ensures ongoing interest.  We are also interested in developing tips to help new amateurs develop skills in using software used to collect the data. Which might include Python, ASCII files, GnuRadio, or Radio Sky-Pipe.	

The next steps are many.  While the SARA analytical section can post initial results on its website, the actual database needs to be created.  Hereâ€™s where you the reader can help.  This effort always needs volunteers, and a set of ongoing activities is listed below.  If you have skill sets and are interested in the following contact us.

 * Providing examples of observations (formats, programming, collected data, etc.)
 * Writing explanation of how the data was obtained or how the programming was created
 * Programming for the database
 * Collecting actual observation data
 * Developing techniques for RASDR as a common use radio telescope system in coordination with the database
 * Advising on the database expansion for other targets 
 * Providing raw data examples and showing how to process it with online programs (Python, GNU)
 * Consulting with stakeholders to expand the citizen science program.
 * Encouraging university student participation and projects related to this program
 * Helping to populate the SARA section web pages for gaps in knowledge important for amateur radio astronomy observing 

This is a long-term project.  Think decades, not weeks. What you contribute over a long period of times builds the SARA of tomorrow, and with it the field of amateur radio astronomy.
